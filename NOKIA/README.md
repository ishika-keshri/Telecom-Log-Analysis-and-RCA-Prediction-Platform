📡 Telecom Log Analyzer and Root Cause Prediction
This project is a web-based system that automates the analysis of telecom logs through the following key stages:

Log Parsing and Insight Generation
Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Improvement
It provides an intuitive UI to input logs, view parsed insights, predict root causes, and enhance model learning with feedback.

🚀 Features
🧾 Log Parsing: Automatically extracts structured information from unstructured telecom logs.
🔍 Insight Generation: Highlights key entities, time stamps, error codes, and systems involved.
🧠 Root Cause Analysis: Uses a machine learning model to predict potential causes.
♻️ Reinforcement Learning: Allows users to give feedback to improve the model.
🎨 Responsive and visually appealing UI with CSS enhancements.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS (custom design), JavaScript
Backend: Python 3, Flask
ML: (Simulated) ML model for RCA with mock predictions
Future: Real-time parsing & model deployment
📊 Workflow Overview
1️⃣ Log Parsing and Insight Generation
Input: Raw log text
Process:
Extract error keywords
Parse timestamps, IPs, or node IDs
Identify log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
Output: Parsed insights shown to user before prediction
2️⃣ Root Cause Analysis
Input: Parsed or raw log
Output: Top predicted cause + confidence %
3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
Input: Log + actual root cause
Process: Update model with feedback and calculate reward
Output: Confirmation with reward metric
🧪 Getting Started
✅ Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask (install via pip)
🔧 Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-rca.git
cd telecom-rca
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Visit: http://localhost:5000

💡 Example Use Cases
🔍 Insight Generation
Input: "2023-08-12 11:04:33 ERROR: Timeout at Node B"

Output:

Timestamp: 2023-08-12 11:04:33

Level: ERROR

Entity: Node B

🧠 Root Cause Prediction
Prediction: Network Congestion

Confidence: 87.43%

♻️ RL Feedback
Input Actual Cause: Hardware Fault

Reward: 8.24
